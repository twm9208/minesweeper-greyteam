The code that I based this off of can be found here: https://iq.opengenus.org/minesweeper-game-using-js/

Everything else is my own modifications

How to play:
1. Load the window, you will be prompted with a box to enter a code. 
    a. If this is the first time, just leave it blank for a random 10x12 with 20 mines
    b. If you already have a code ready (See 2.b.) enter it. Case sensitive.
2. There is a placing button. If you just want to play, ignore it. Click the green starting square and it will go away
    a. If you want to modify the map, click placing and then you'll see the mines and you can right click to place more.
    b. A code will be displayed and updated on every bomb placement. You can copy this to share your map. 
    c. Left clicking anywhere on the board will take you out of placing mode, hide the bombs, and hide the code/placing button. 
3. Controls
    a. Left click to reveal a cell
    b. Right click to flag a cell
    c. Middle click on a revealed cell to click all adjacent non-flagged cells. 
    d. Basic minesweeper stuff. 
4. There is no victory screen, just a score. Each revealed cell is one point.
